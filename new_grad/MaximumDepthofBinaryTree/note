1. Forget to test the case when root node is NULL
2. The convention of tree depth is 1-indexed

#Ref Answer
It is smarter because it does not use any additional parameter.
It is more like a DP solution. 

First filter out simple casese when subtree has only 0 or 1 level.
Then get the leftside depth and right side depth, and then compare. 

My first mimic version is still wrong, because I forgot to do the
accumulation.

1. if you want to create a string from a char, please use 
`string x = string(1, char);
2. for add operation, the res should be gotten from by using the '%' not '/'

Future Work:
    Can you get rid of the private _carry variable later?
    Currently add function need to modify it implictly, which is not very good because _carry
    could be modifed by other function as well. 
    Can you pass in the pointer to the parameter?
    What about a reference?

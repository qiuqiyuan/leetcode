helpful thoughts for solving DP problems. 
1. Try to imagine what the answer may look like. 
2. Think about the problem starting from the final answer. 
Try to assume you already know the cost to get all sub problems, and 
find the way to compose all subsolutions into a solution for the 
solution to a greater problem.
3. For different ways to arrive at the final solution, try to encode them
using some state label. 
4. Think how you can teardown the problem from a larger one into serval
smaller ones. All the way to the base case.
5. Solve the base case.
